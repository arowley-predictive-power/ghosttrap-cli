# ghosttrap-cli

The developer-side listener for [ghosttrap](https://ghosttrap.io). Connects errors from remote servers to Claude Code in real time.

## Setup

Requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

```
pip install ghosttrap-cli
cd ~/your-project
ghosttrap setup
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/ghosttrap
```

That's it. `setup` authenticates via `gh`, claims the repo, and installs a Claude Code skill. The `/ghosttrap` skill handles everything else — it installs the SDK into your app, wires in the error hooks, and starts monitoring.

## What happens next

The skill file tells Claude Code to run `ghosttrap peek` in the background. Peek opens a WebSocket to ghosttrap.io and waits. When a production error arrives, Claude sees the full traceback — exception type, message, file, line, function — and starts fixing.

After fixing, Claude restarts peek and waits for the next one. Errors become a real-time stream that your AI agent dispatches automatically.

## The SDK

Your app needs [ghosttrap-sdk](https://github.com/arowley-predictive-power/ghosttrap-sdk) to report errors. The Claude Code skill handles the integration automatically — it installs the SDK, wires it into your app, and adds Django/Celery hooks if applicable. You shouldn't need to touch the SDK manually.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ghosttrap setup` | Claim a repo, install the Claude Code skill |
| `ghosttrap peek` | Wait for the next error, print it, exit |
| `ghosttrap watch` | Stream all errors continuously |

## How it works

- **Setup** authenticates with GitHub to prove you own the repo, then saves a token locally
- **Peek** and **watch** connect to ghosttrap.io using that token — no GitHub auth needed after setup
- Errors that arrive while you're offline are replayed on next connect (cursor-based, no duplicates)
- Local state is stored in `~/.ghosttrap/config.json`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) — used for authentication during setup
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — the AI agent that fixes your errors
- macOS or Linux (Windows is untested)

## Privacy

Error data (tracebacks, exception messages, file paths) is routed through ghosttrap.io. The server is not open source yet — if there's demand for self-hosting, we'll open it up. Your GitHub token is used only during `setup` to verify repo ownership; it's never stored on the server. After setup, all communication uses a repo-specific token that grants access only to that repo's error stream — it cannot access your GitHub account.
